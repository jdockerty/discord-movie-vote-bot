## Overview

Simple Discord bot for counting the number of votes in a given list of movies for the movie night on Discord.

## Install

Dependencies can be installed into a virtual environment, with pip, using the commands

```
python3 -m venv <virtual_env_name>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

or using the convenience provided in the `makefile` with 
    
    make install
    source env/bin/activate

## Usage

Requires an API key from Discord Developer Portal for usage inside of the `os.getenv['API_KEY']` and a channel ID for the appropriate channel messages are to be placed into, this is retrieved via `os.getenv['CHANNEL_ID']` as part of running the client.

Within the designated channel the commands are:

* `!newvote movie 1, movie 2, movie 3, ...` starts a new vote, only those with the role of 'Admin' can begin a vote.
* `!vote X Y Z` allows people to vote after a new vote has begun, the values correspond to the numerical value within list that is presented by the bot. Votes are weighted in order: the first vote is worth 3 points, the second is worth 2, and the last vote is worth 1.
* `!changevote X Y Z` someone can change their vote if it has already been cast, reusing `!vote` would stop them duplicating the vote.
* `!endvote` will end the vote casting and write the movie with the highest number of points into the channel.

## Deployment

A simple automated deployment is achieved through a t2.micro Ubuntu instance on AWS. The Python file requires the a `.env` file with the relevant `API_KEY` from the Discord Developer Portal to run the bot, this is stored in S3. The role to read objects is assigned to the instance upon creation in Terraform with the appropriate `user_data` script being executed to download the latest version of the GitHub repo and download the dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file, the bot is then run afterwards.
